BASICS OF CSS:-

1,What is CSS?
Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. 
CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.

For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:

p {
  color: red;
}

2, CSS Editors:-

Some of the popular editors that are best suited to wire CSS code are as following:

-->Atom
-->Visual Studio Code
-->Brackets
-->Espresso(For Mac OS  User)
-->Notepad++(Great for HTML & CSS)
-->Komodo Edit (Simple)
-->Sublime Text (Best Editor)

3, CSS Syntax:-

 Selector {
  		 Property 1 : value;
                	 Property 2 : value;
               	 Property 3 : value;
             }
  For example:
         h1
            {
                Color: red;
                 Text-align: center;

            }
          #unique 
           {
                 color: green;
           }

-->Selector: selects the element you want to target
-->Always remains the same whether we apply internal or external styling 
-->There are few basic selectors like tags, id’s, and classes
-->All forms this key-value pair
-->Keys: properties(attributes) like color, font-size, background, width, height,etc
-->Value: values associated with these properties


4,CSS Selectors:-

The selector is used to target elements and apply CSS 
Three simple selectors
Element Selector 
Id Selector
Class Selector
Priority of Selectors
Id > Class>Element

5,CSS Colors:-

There are different colouring schemes in CSS
Three widely used techniques are as follows

RGB:-

This starts with RGB and takes 3 parameter
3 parameter basically corresponds to red, green and blue
The value of each parameter may vary from 0 to 255.
Eg: RGB(255,0,0); means color red

HEX:-

Hex code starts with # and comprises of 6 numbers which are further divided into 3 sets
Sets basically correspond to Red, Green, and Blue
Single set value can vary from 00 to 09 and AA to FF
Eg: #ff0000 ; means color red

RGBA:-

This starts with RGB and takes 4 parameter
4 parameter basically corresponds to red, green, blue and alpha
Value of the first three parameters may vary from 0 to 255 and the last parameter ranges from 0 to 1 that is from 0.1, 0.2,…..0.9
Eg: RGB(255,0,0,0); means color red

6, CSS Background:-

There are different ways by which CSS can have an effect on HTML elements

Few of them are as follows:

Color – used to set the color of the background
Repeat – used to determine if the image has to repeat or not and if it is repeating then how it should do that
Image – used to set an image as the background
Position – used to determine the position of the image
Attachment – It basically helps in controlling the mechanism of scrolling

7,CSS Border:-

Helps in setting up the border for HTML elements

There are 4 properties that can help in setting up of border:

Width – sets the width of the border
Style – sets the style of border; Eg: solid, dashed etc.
Color – sets the color of the border
Radius – determines the roundness of the border
You can set the border for specifically top, right, bottom and left
We can also club top and bottom together and same goes for left and right

Eg: border-width: 2px 5px;   sets top and bottom 2px; left and right 5px
Border can also be set in a single line

Eg: border : 2px solid blue;
