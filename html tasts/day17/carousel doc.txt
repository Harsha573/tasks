BOOTSTRAP-CAROUSEL:-

The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. 
It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. 
It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.

WE CAN USE IN DIFFERENT TYPES LIKE:-

-->Slides only

-->With controls

Adding in the previous and next controls.

-->With indicators

You can also add the indicators to the carousel, alongside the controls, too.

-->With captions

Add captions to your slides easily with the .carousel-caption element within any .carousel-item. 
They can be easily hidden on smaller viewports, as shown below, with optional display utilities. We hide them initially with .
d-none and bring them back on medium-sized devices with .d-md-block.

-->Crossfade

Add .carousel-fade to your carousel to animate slides with a fade transition instead of a slide.

-->Individual .carousel-item interval

Add data-interval="" to a .carousel-item to change the amount of time to delay between automatically cycling to the next item.
