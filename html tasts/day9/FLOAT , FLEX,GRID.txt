Difference between FLOAT, FLEX and Grid:-

FLOAT:-

==>The float CSS property is used to position the elements to the left, right, of its container along with permitting the text and inline elements to wrap around it. 
==>The float property defines the flow of content in the page. 
==>The remaining elements will be part of the flow if the element is removed from the normal flow of the content. 
==>This property is ignored by the absolutely positioned elements. 
==>It can be written in a CSS file or can be directly specified in the style of an element.
==>Syntax:

float: none|left|right|initial|inherit;

FLEX:-

==>The flex CSS shorthand property is the combination of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis property. 
==>It is used to set the length of flexible items. 
==>The flex property is much responsive and mobile-friendly. 
==>It is easy to position child elements and the main container. 
==>The margin doesnâ€™t collapse with the content margins. 
==>The order of any element can be easily changed without editing the HTML section.

==>Syntax:

flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis|auto|initial|inherit;


GRID:-

==>The CSS Grid Layout module is used to create a grid-based layout system, 
with the help of rows and columns it makes easier to design any webpage without using floats and positioning.

==>Syntax: 
 

.class {
    display:grid;
