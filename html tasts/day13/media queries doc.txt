CSS Media Queries:-

==>CSS2 Introduced Media Types:-

The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

==>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries:-

Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

Media Query Syntax:-

A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more expressions, which resolve to either true or false.

@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  CSS-Code;
}

==>CSS3 Media Types:-
