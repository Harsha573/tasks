BACKGROUND IN CSS:-

The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.

Types of Background in css:-

-->background-color
-->background-image
-->background-repeat
-->background-attachment
-->background-position
-->background(shorthand property)

[1]CSS background-color:-

The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

Example:-

The background color of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

==>With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

->a valid color name - like "red"
->a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
->an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"

[2]CSS background-image:-

The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Example:-

Set the background image for a page: 

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

[3]CSS background-repeat:-

By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:

Example:-

body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}

=>CSS background-repeat: no-repeat:-

Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:

Example:-

Show the background image only once:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

==>CSS background-position:-

The background-position property is used to specify the position of the background image.

Example:-

Position the background image in the top-right corner: 

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}

[4]CSS background-attachment:-

The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):

Example:-

Specify that the background image should be fixed:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}

[5]CSS background - Shorthand property:-

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}

==>When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. 
Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.
